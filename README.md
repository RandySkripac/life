# life
This java file is one designed to help me achieve my life goals.
Executing the code asks the user if it's a work day (my work schedule is 6am to 230pm) and tells the user (me) what hobbies to work on for today. 

This helped me during the pandemic to stay sane and productive. It also tells me what workouts to do so that I take care of my body.

Future implimentations:

* Connecting to my SQL Database of golf courses to explain the course that life.java chooses for me to play. 
* Scrape weather.com and only tell me to play outdoor sports when it won't rain.
* Impliment User Interface so it's not just a console interaction.
